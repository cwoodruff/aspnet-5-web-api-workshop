# Workshop Home

For the source code for the workshop visit the [ASP.NET 5 Web API Workshop](https://github.com/cwoodruff/aspnet-5-web-api-workshop ) GitHub repo.

Interested in learning about designing, architecting and developing Web APIs using ASP.NET 5?

I am looking at updating the content and code demos to ASP.NET 6 before 2022 and then have several workshops in the first half of the new year! Ask me about doing a workshop. My email is [cwoodruff@live.com](mailto:cwoodruff@live.com).
